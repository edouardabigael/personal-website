# Personal Website Starter Code
Hello! If you're reading this, then you may be wondering, why does this file say 'starter code' my coding journey began the summer before 9th grade when I attended the girls who code summer program. I learned different programming skills while also digging deeper into the ethics and impact a simple website can have on another individual. While I am coding this entire website by hand, I couldn't bring myself to delete the entirety of this README because Girls Who Code is what made me the programmer I am today. Thanks for reading this trip down memory lane, and I hope you enjoy my website!
